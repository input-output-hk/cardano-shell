-- Let's presume that we have the order of the features like this:
-- 1. logging
-- 2. networking
-- 3. blockchain
-- 4. ledger
-- 5. wallet?

-- The important bit here is that @LogginLayer@ and @LoggingCardanoFeature@ don't know anything
-- about networking, the same way that @NetworkLayer@ and @NetworkingCardanoFeature@ doesn't know
-- anything about blockchain, and so on.
-- The same can be said about the configuration.
-- In summary, the two things that the team implementing these should know is it's configuration and it's
-- result, which is a layer (a list of functions that we provide via the record function interface).
-- So they live in separate modules, contain only what they need and are private. Their implementation can be changed
-- anytime.
-- Another interesting thing is that we stack the effects ONLY when we use a function from
-- another layer, and we don't get all the effects, just the ones the function contains.
